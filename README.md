### a. Instructions about how to run and test your code.

### `npm i`
this command will install all the dependency 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### b. List elements from the challenge that you think you have done well, and that exemplify your proficiency. Please describe why you chose those elements, and how they demonstrate your proficiency.
1. Proper Folder Structure
2. I have used typescript
3. Implemented redux as implemented
4. Proper coding standards


### c. List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours available for this task. Describe why you would do those things.
1. Will work on ui and try to write test cases as mentioned
2. Ui optimization would have created all the components from scratch intead using materail ui

### d. Optional: Any feedback about how we may improve this challenge.
1. Things would have been easy if all the api need to get the are available in the document. Going through tmdb documentation takes a lot of time.
